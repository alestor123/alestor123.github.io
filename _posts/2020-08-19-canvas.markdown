# What is HTML Canvas?
## The HTML`` <canvas>`` element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.

## The ``<canvas>`` element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.

## Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

# Canvas Examples

## A canvas is a rectangular area on an HTML page. By default, a canvas has no border and no content.


The markup looks like this:

```<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>```

## Note: Always specify an id attribute (to be referred to in a script), and a width and height attribute to define the size of the canvas. To add a border, use the style attribute.

## Here is an example of a basic, empty canvas:


# Add a JavaScript
## Draw a Line

```
<script>
var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
ctx.moveTo(0, 0);
ctx.lineTo(200, 100);
ctx.stroke();
</script>
```
# Conclusion


# Keep Coding !!!
