# Year Review 2024

Alright, buckle up, folks! Let‚Äôs dive into my thrilling, edge-of-your-seat, blockbuster adventure that is the year 2024. And by "blockbuster," I mean a drama-filled, meme-worthy series of unfortunate events sprinkled with just enough wins to keep me from throwing in the towel. Imagine Deadpool narrating the life of a teenage student, and boom ‚Äî here we are. Let‚Äôs get this roast started.

## Exams: The Hunger Games Edition

So, 2024 was supposed to be my big moment ‚Äî my "Avengers Assemble" year. Instead, it turned into the "Snakes on a Plane" of my life. First up, January. JEE Mains. Oh, sweet January, the month where I thought I‚Äôd crush it. Plot twist: it crushed me. Scored an impressive 83 percentile. Impressive if I‚Äôd been aiming for mediocrity, that is.

But wait, there‚Äôs more! The lab exams decided to gatecrash my JEE pity party. Without my awesome teachers, who basically carried me through, I‚Äôd have flopped harder than a fish out of water. Thanks to them, I aced most of my lab exams. Chemistry, though? .

Then came the model exams. And me being me, I studied... seven hours before the first paper. Procrastination level: Jedi Master. Somehow, I passed. No idea how. Maybe the examiners saw my name and thought, "Poor kid, let‚Äôs not ruin his life any further."

And then, the final boss: board exams. Stretching over weeks like an unnecessary Netflix series. I spent most of my time pretending to study while binge-scrolling memes. The strategy? Open the book the night before, cram like it‚Äôs the apocalypse, and hope for the best. (Insert "It‚Äôs fine, everything‚Äôs fine" meme.)

## College: The Plot Thickens

So, after surviving the exam Hunger Games, I got my KEAM results. Ranked around 2.3k. Not bad, right? That got me into Model Engineering College (MEC). And let me tell you, entering college was like jumping into a new Netflix show without knowing the plot.

At first, it was all mixed emotions. New place, new people, new cafeteria food to judge. I didn‚Äôt know 25% of my classmates‚Äô names. I‚Äôm great with faces, though, so there‚Äôs that. Slowly, I realized MEC was the right choice. My classmates? Total legends. Turns out, they‚Äôre amazing at extracurriculars, which totally changed my perspective.

College life hasn‚Äôt been all fun and games, though. Exams happened. Stress happened. Sleep? What‚Äôs that? Still, it‚Äôs been worth it.

## Events: Nerd Nirvana

2024 wasn‚Äôt just about exams and lectures. I hit up some cool events too. First, the IEDC Summit at NIT Calicut. Workshops, exploring Kozhikode, and making memories with friends.

Then came the Python Conference at MEC. Yours truly gave a quick talk about applications of CL. Yup, I actually spoke at a developer conference. (Cue applause and standing ovation from imaginary audience.) It was nerve-wracking but also amazing.

## Trips: A Little Wanderlust

Managed a quick trip to Trivandrum for personal reasons. Visited a bunch of places, had some fun, and recharged my batteries. Traveling always helps remind me that there‚Äôs more to life than exams and deadlines. 

Final Thoughts: Meh, But Also Yay?

2024 was a mixed bag. Plenty of setbacks, but also some solid wins. I learned that life‚Äôs like a Marvel movie ‚Äî full of surprises, bad guys (a.k.a. exams), and the occasional epic moment. Here‚Äôs hoping 2025 is more "Endgame" and less "Thor: The Dark World."

Cheers to surviving! Let‚Äôs raise a glass (of chai) to fewer disasters . year ahead.
