# So Whats the matter ? 

As Developers we have a lot of projects flying around other hoping its gonna take over the world. Some of them do their work we wont get the same  excitement after we are starting a project and you'll end in second thoughts and you will come up with thoughts of scrapping them thus not getting anything out of them except the loss of time. These excuses,mostly start with, it won‚Äôt work because (some excuse) Like : 

..I don‚Äôt have enough money


..no body is going to invest


..it ain‚Äôt worth the risk


All of us have questions like this when we think of accomplishing something new. And it is usually the questions like this which hinder our way to the success.  In my experience, I have come to terms with the fact that it all depends on your reaction whether you take the excuses like these as challenges to be tackled or as the reasons for why you will fail.

# Thinking success conditions your mind to create plans that produce success. Thinking failure does the exact opposite.

# Failure thinking conditions the mind to think other thoughts that create failure.

 
I have done so many side projects and put them on the shelf, staying in the safe zone . And you should change that.

And thats it. What are you afraid of? What is it that is holding you back? What is your excuse to not start? put your the comment section below

# Conclusion

# Keep Coding !!!
