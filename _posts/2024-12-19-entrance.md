# Entrance Exam Prep: Because Who Needs Sleep or a Social Life, Anyway?

Hey there, folks! If you've been stalking my GitHub activity (none of you are, but that's okay), you might have noticed that I‚Äôve been radio silent for about 2.5 years. Now, before you assume I was busy rescuing kittens or single-handedly saving the planet, I was neck-deep in the chaotic circus called college entrance exams.
If you‚Äôre gearing up for this rollercoaster, congrats! You‚Äôre about to dive headfirst into an exciting adventure featuring late nights, infinite stress, and a constant existential crisis.

## Chapter 1: A Humble Beginning

Once upon a time, I was a na√Øve 10th grader with decent grades . I joined one of those ‚Äúprestigious‚Äù institutions‚Äîthe kind that make you feel important just by walking through their gates. For the first three chapters of every subject, life felt manageable. I was doing okay.


## Chapter 2: The Great Downfall
And then... cue dramatic music... it all went to hell.

Studies turned into a puzzle I couldn‚Äôt solve, and my confidence took a nosedive. By the end of it, I was a mess. Math problems felt like they were written in ancient Greek. I began messing up left, right, and center. By the end of it, I was a certified disaster. My grades? Let‚Äôs just say they were the academic equivalent of a dumpster fire. My confidence was in shambles, and my dreams of a shiny engineering college were fading faster than my Wi-Fi during a Zoom class.

## Chapter 3: Lightbulb Moment
Just before my 11th-grade series test, I had a realization. It hit me like a physics textbook to the face: If I keep going like this, I‚Äôm going to ruin my future.
So, I decided to start working. That test became my redemption arc. Spoiler alert: It worked.(Some what)

## Chapter 4: Redemption (Sort Of)
Fast forward to JEE. My first attempt? Let‚Äôs call it a spectacular Disaster. Big, fat failure. But I wasn‚Äôt done. I tried again, and while I didn‚Äôt break any records, I improved significantly.Pogress is progress, right?
Then came a whirlwind of exams: VIT, CUSAT CAT, KEAM‚Äîbasically, the Infinity Stones of engineering entrances. I didn‚Äôt want to leave any stone unturned, so I threw myself at all of them

Eventually, I settled on KEAM and landed at the Government Model Engineering College, Thrikkakara. (Yes, it‚Äôs a real place. You can Google it. I‚Äôll wait. Seriously, go ahead. ) The campus isn‚Äôt IIT, but hey, it‚Äôs got electricity and Wi-Fi(speed in range of Kbps) most of the time. What more could a budding engineer ask for?.I joined Computer Science and Engineering. Because nothing screams "future-proof" like the promise of being able to debug a few lines of code.

## Non-Academic Observations: The Real Lessons
Now, let‚Äôs talk about the stuff they don‚Äôt teach you in school but should.

### Suffering Is Mandatory
You‚Äôre going to suffer. Accept it. Embrace it. Make it your thing. No pain, no gain, right?

Perfection Is a Scam
Nobody cares if your answer is perfect. They only care if it‚Äôs right. So, ditch the perfectionist mindset and focus on getting the job done.

### Live in the Moment
Stop obsessing over the future or regretting the past. Just focus on surviving today.

###  Give It 200%
Half-hearted effort won‚Äôt cut it. Go all in, or you‚Äôll spend the rest of your life wondering what could have been.

###  Everything Is an Experience
Success, failure, stress-induced breakdowns‚Äîthey‚Äôre all part of the ride. Learn from them.

## Academic Observations: The Boring But Important Stuff
Alright, let‚Äôs get nerdy.

###  Math and Physics Are Your Lifeline
If you‚Äôre pursuing engineering, these two subjects are non-negotiable. Whether it‚Äôs calculus, linear algebra, or semiconductor physics, you‚Äôll need a strong foundation to survive college. Trust me, this stuff comes back to haunt you in your first semester.

###  Consistency Beats Cramming
Studying a little every day is way better than pulling all-nighters. Unless you enjoy looking like a zombie.

### PYQs Are Your New Best Friend
Forget shiny study materials and expensive guides. Previous Year Questions (PYQs) are all you need. I started prepping for KEAM just seven days before the exam using PYQs and still managed a 2k rank. Luck ?Coincidence? I think not.

###  Board Exams? Meh.
You don‚Äôt need months of prep to ace board exams. Two weeks of focused study will do. (Disclaimer: Starting your chemistry lab prep seven hours before the exam is not a recommended strategy. Don‚Äôt ask me how I know.)

### College Subjects Start in 11th and 12th
Everything you study in college‚Äîespecially in engineering‚Äîhas its roots in high school. Physics and math are everywhere. So, if you‚Äôre thinking of skipping those subjects now, think again.
College-level subjects are built on 11th and 12th-grade concepts. Physics and math, especially, will haunt or help‚Äîyou throughout your engineering journey.

Final Words of Wisdom
Entrance exams are brutal, but they‚Äôre also temporary. Keep your head down, work hard, and remember: nobody cares how you got through the grind as long as you do. And once you‚Äôre done, you‚Äôll look back and realize it was all worth it.

Now go forth and conquer those exams. And while you‚Äôre at it, don‚Äôt forget to stop by my GitHub‚Äîjust to see what two years of stress-induced absence can do to a repo. Cheers!
